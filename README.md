# freeCodeCamp Technical Documentation Page

### View on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/strugglebunny/full/gOmKaob)

A technical documentation page built for [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com)'s Responsive Web Design Certification.

Since I don't really have any idea for what use for content, this page will be a clone of their [example page](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/NdrKKL). Although the content and look may be similar, all code is my own.
